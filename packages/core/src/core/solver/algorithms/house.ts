/**
 * Find naked sets inside one house.
 *
 * A set counts as "usable" only when it can eliminate a candidate from some
 * other unsolved cell in the same house. Sets that eliminate nothing are
 * skipped.
 *
 * Results are union masks, not cell lists. The members are the cells whose
 * candidates fit inside the mask, so the caller can recover them if it needs
 * them. Keeping the finder mask-only makes it as cheap as possible: it marks a
 * union as soon as it is actionable and leaves everything else to the caller.
 *
 * - Default (no `size`): search every size k up to floor(unsolved / 2) and
 *   return every usable set found. Once cells are used by a set they leave the
 *   pool, so overlapping alternatives are not enumerated — the result is a
 *   maximal collection of disjoint minimal sets. The cap is a speed tradeoff
 *   for unattended full solves (stateful solvers, no user interaction), so it
 *   can miss a larger set in a small house, e.g. a usable triple when only 5
 *   cells are unsolved. Pass `size` to force a size.
 * - `size: n`: return usable sets of size n only. Smaller sizes are not
 *   searched first. For the currently supported sizes (n <= 4), minimality is
 *   enforced on the set itself: every digit must be held by at least two of its
 *   cells, so no smaller naked set can fit inside it.
 * - `first: true`: stop at the first usable set and return it.
 * - Returns `null` when no usable set matches the request.
 * - Throws `IllegalStateError` when a found set's digits enclose more cells
 *   than the set can hold (e.g. three cells sharing the same pair). This is
 *   only detected for sizes the search actually reaches.
 *
 * Generalization notes (the current implementation is 9x9-oriented):
 * - Only `size` 2..4 is accepted; `n > 4` throws. The default search is also
 *   capped at `floor(unsolved / 2)`, which is at most 4 in a 9-cell house.
 * - The forced-size minimality check only rules out an `(n-1)`-subset. That is
 *   enough for n = 4 because pairs are pre-excluded and 3 is the only smaller
 *   size. It is not enough for n >= 5: a 5-set can contain a naked triple while
 *   every digit still appears at least twice. To keep skipping k = 3..n-1 for
 *   larger n, either consume every smaller size first or reject a found set
 *   when any proper subset of size 3..n-1 has a union of exactly that many
 *   digits (at most 2^n subsets; n <= 8 for a 16-cell house).
 * - The `n > 4` guard should become `floor(house.length / 2)` (or a digit-count
 *   limit). The `house` parameter is already `readonly number[]`, so a 16-cell
 *   unit needs no signature change, and bits 1..16 fit in the current 32-bit
 *   candidate masks.
 * - Outside this finder, the 9x9 assumptions live in `constants/cordinates.ts`
 *   (ROWS/COLUMNS/BOXES/PEERS), `constants/bitwise.ts` (FULL_DIGIT_MASK and the
 *   row/column/line masks), `utils/bitwise.ts` (resolveCandidates hardcodes 9),
 *   `utils/board.ts` (sanitizeCandidates hardcodes 81 and PEERS;
 *   candidatesToDigitMasks loops 1..9), and `core/generator.ts`.
